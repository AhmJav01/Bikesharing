## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to learn how to use Tableau to create multiple graphs from an excel sheet database. The database used was from CitiBike from 2019 and was used to create a total of 7 graphs. Each graph was creeated by Tableau by using different datapoints in the database.

## Summary
The previous figures have shown that men tend to be the most users of CitiBike, followed by women. The most popular hours the people use CitiBike are 8:00 am, 5:00pm, and 6:00pm. 
The heaviest concentration of users are Male Subscribers as shown in Figure 4. 
Two potential visualizations that could be created would be:
1. The tripdurations for Subscribers vs Customers
2. Which generation uses CitiBike the most (Birthyear vs Weekday vs Hour)
